* Friendship concept was handled as a bidirectional association (e.g user_a and user_b friendship will be represented as only one Friendship table entry, whether user_a or user_b value is on first_friend or second_friend attribute will be exactly the same for the system.)

## Services

This project has 3 main services.

* PaymentService handles the logic for creating a payment between two users. First it will validate that the receiver user is friend of the sender user and if the amount of money is a positive value, displaying the respective error message in case of failure. Then it will validate that the sender user's balance is equal or greater than the amount to transfer, if it's not it will proceed to call the service explained below. Finally if validations passed, a payment and a feed will be created.

* Money Transfer Service mocks an external payment source connection which is called whenever a user tries to transfer an amount greater than his account's balance. The service will act as a successful request to an external party and will add the required value for the user to make the transfer.

* FeedService will return all the payments that a given user should see on their feed. Such collection will be composed by his own payments plus his friends payments.
